# prismacolor_book
ACB color book file for Photoshop containing the 150 digitalized colors of Prismacolor Premier® Soft Core pencils.

This file adapts the ANPA color book file contained in Photoshop's default installation to reflect the digitalized colors of the 150 Prismacolor Premier® Soft Core pencils.

Simply copy the ACB file into the directory \Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS*\Presets\Color Books.

Then it will automatically appear among the catalog options when clicking for 'personalized colors' in the color picker window, under the name "PRSM Color". The names of each digital color match the numbers in the colored pencils.

Using the color picker tool on any point of an image, this will give you the closest match among the Prismacolor pencils.

*This should work in Photoshop CS and all subsequent versions.
